# full-projects

We are a team of four members under the name: Simulation education 1. We study 'Multimedia & Creative Technology' at ErasmusHogeschool Brussels.

Our mission is to create a website for our client 'NSH: Network Simulation Healthcare' in a period of three weeks. They asked us to make a site with a fresh dynamic atmosphere with some technical assets. Assets like a chat forum and researches which can be added if wanted.

First week: We began with brainstorming to have an idea which athmospheres we can use for the website. With this information we made three moodboards, a first visual. Later on we attacked on working the wireframes and the webdesign. At the end of the week we decided on one prototype to work further with.

Second week: This week we began coding the website but a static version. We also received an extra task on a creative level. Ours is a poster, we made three of them with each a different phrase. These phrases purpose is to convince people to rather work on simulation dolls than on real people in the healthcare.

Third week: The coding went further on with extra features like a chat forum and researches you can add. To give the website a dynamic touch, we animated figures around the pictures. Then we figured how to only access the research page and tips & tricks page when you're logged in. In the login page we also integrated an error message when you fill wrong information in the form.
The last extra task is to make a videoblog about our project experience.
